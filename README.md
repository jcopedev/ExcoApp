Open CMD prompt
Navigate to your xampp htdocs folder (Mine is C:\xampp\htdocs, but yours might be different
git stuff

Start Xampp Start Apache--We don't need SQL ;-) <br>
Navigate to: localhost/excoapp The index.html should come automatically <br>
Try posting--don't say anything mean, because we'll actually be able to see it in the database <br>
Try deleting something in the limited timeline, it will prompt you to sign up <br>
Navigate to authentication sign up either with google or email password.<br> 
Use real credentials It should redirect you to your user profile with a "full timeline" <br>
That's all I have so far, and nothing is set in stone, but some features I'm very attached to.<br>
